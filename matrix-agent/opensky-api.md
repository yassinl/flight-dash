OpenSky REST API¶
The root URL of our REST API is:

https://opensky-network.org/api
There are several functions available to retrieve state vectors, flights and tracks for the whole network, a particular sensor, or a particular aircraft. Note that the functions to retrieve state vectors of sensors other than your own are rate limited (see Limitations).

All State Vectors¶
The following API call can be used to retrieve any state vector of the OpenSky. Please note that rate limits apply for this call (see Limitations). For API calls without rate limitation, see Own State Vectors.

Operation¶
GET /states/all

Limitations¶
Limitiations for anonymous (unauthenticated) users¶
Anonymous are those users who access the API without using credentials. The limitations for anonymous users are:

Anonymous users can only get the most recent state vectors, i.e. the time parameter will be ignored.

Anonymous users can only retrieve data with a time resolution of 10 seconds. That means, the API will return state vectors for time 𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 −(𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 𝑚⁢𝑜⁢𝑑 10).

Anonymous users get 400 API credits per day (see credit usage below).

Limitations for OpenSky users¶
Note

IMPORTANT: Basic authentication using your username and password is deprecated on March 18, 2026. To access the REST API, all accounts must follow the instructions in the section below on using the OAuth2 client credentials flow.

An OpenSky user is anybody who uses a valid OpenSky account or corresponding API client to access the API. The rate limitations for OpenSky users are:

OpenSky users clients can retrieve data of up to 1 hour in the past. If the time parameter has a value 𝑡 <𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 −3600 the API will return 400 Bad Request.

OpenSky users can retrieve data with a time resolution of 5 seconds. That means, if the time parameter was set to 𝑡, the API will return state vectors for time 𝑡 −(𝑡 𝑚⁢𝑜⁢𝑑 5).

OpenSky users get 4000 API credits per day. This is also true for the default privileges when using the API client. For higher request loads please contact OpenSky.

Active contributing OpenSky users get a total of 8000 API credits per day. An active user is a user which has an ADS-B receiver that is at least 30% online (measured over the current month).

Note

If you are feeding and using the API client it will take 50+ requests before your credit allowance is increased to 8000. This new credit allowance is dynamic and not tied to any role so you will still see the default role with 4000 credits in the API client info. To verirfy you are getting 8000 credits inspect the x-rate-limit-remaining response header. If at times (like the start of the day) it is greater than 4000 then you will be getting the 8000 credit allowance. This is exactly the same as how things work with basic authentication.

Note

You can retrieve all state vectors received by your receivers without any restrictions. See Own State Vectors. Before the request limit is reached the header X-Rate-Limit-Remaining indicates the amount of remaining credits. After the rate limit is reached the status code 429 - Too Many Requests is returned and the header X-Rate-Limit-Retry-After-Seconds indicates how many seconds until credits/request become available again.

This is currently not working for the API client and is in the process of being fixed.

OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow¶
To authenticate using a modern and secure method, OpenSky now exclusively supports the OAuth2 client credentials flow. Basic authentication with username and password is not possible anymore.

To get started:

Log in to your OpenSky account and visit the Account page.

Create a new API client and retrieve your client_id and client_secret.

Use these credentials to obtain an access token from the OpenSky authentication server.

Here is an example using curl to obtain an access token:

export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

export TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" | jq -r .access_token)
Once you have an access token, include it in the Authorization header of your API requests:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all | jq .
The token will expire after 30 minutes. You can repeat the above request to obtain a new token as needed. If a request returns a 401 Unauthorized response, it likely means the token has expired or is invalid.

/states/all and other authenticated endpoints require this token-based authentication for non-legacy accounts using your API client.

Python Token Manager Example¶
For longer-running scripts or applications that make multiple API calls, managing token expiry manually can be error-prone. The example below shows a simple TokenManager class that automatically refreshes the token when it is about to expire, so you never have to think about it:

import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

TOKEN_URL = "https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token"
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"

# How many seconds before expiry to proactively refresh the token.
TOKEN_REFRESH_MARGIN = 30


class TokenManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token = None
        self.expires_at = None

    def get_token(self):
        """Return a valid access token, refreshing automatically if needed."""
        if self.token and self.expires_at and datetime.now() < self.expires_at:
            return self.token
        return self._refresh()

    def _refresh(self):
        """Fetch a new access token from the OpenSky authentication server."""
        r = requests.post(
            TOKEN_URL,
            data={
                "grant_type": "client_credentials",
                "client_id": CLIENT_ID,
                "client_secret": CLIENT_SECRET,
            },
        )
        r.raise_for_status()

        data = r.json()
        self.token = data["access_token"]
        expires_in = data.get("expires_in", 1800)
        self.expires_at = datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=expires_in - TOKEN_REFRESH_MARGIN)
        return self.token

    def headers(self):
        """Return request headers with a valid Bearer token."""
        return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.get_token()}"}


# Create a single shared instance for your script.
tokens = TokenManager()

# Use it for any API call — the token is refreshed automatically.
response = requests.get(
    "https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all",
    headers=tokens.headers(),
)
print(response.json())
The key points:

get_token() checks whether the current token is still valid before returning it. A new token is only requested when necessary.

TOKEN_REFRESH_MARGIN (30 seconds) ensures the token is refreshed slightly before it actually expires, avoiding race conditions on long-running requests.

headers() is a convenience method you can pass directly to any requests call.

Create one TokenManager instance and reuse it across all requests in your script rather than instantiating it per call.

API credit usage¶
API credits are now used for all endpoints except /states/own. Credit usage is lower in general for restricted/smaller areas (/states/all) and shorter time frames (/flights and /tracks). For /states/all the credit calculation is done by square degrees. The area can be restricted by using the lamin, lamax, lomin, lomax query parameters. The area square deg column in the table below indicates the square degree limit - e.g. a box extending over latitude 10 degress and longitude 5 degrees, would equal 50 square degrees:

Area square deg

Credits

Example

0 - 25 (<500x500km)

1

/api/states/all?lamin=49.7&lamax=50.5&lomin=3.2&lomax=4.6

25 - 100 (<1000x1000km)

2

/api/states/all?lamin=46.5&lamax=49.9&lomin=-1.4&lomax=6.8

100 - 400 (<2000x2000km)

3

/api/states/all?lamin=42.2&lamax=49.8&lomin=-4.7&lomax=10.9

over 400 or all (>2000x2000km)

4

/api/states/all

For /flights and /tracks the credit usage is calculated by partitions used by the query, which corresponds roughly to number of days queried.

Examples¶
Retrieve all states as an anonymous user:

$ curl -s "https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all" | python -m json.tool
Retrieve all states as an authenticated OpenSky user:

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -s "https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all" | python -m json.tool

Track by Aircraft¶
Note

The tracks endpoint is purely experimental. You can use the flights endpoint for historical data: Flights in Time Interval.

Retrieve the trajectory for a certain aircraft at a given time. The trajectory is a list of waypoints containing position, barometric altitude, true track and an on-ground flag.

In contrast to state vectors, trajectories do not contain all information we have about the flight, but rather show the aircraft’s general movement pattern. For this reason, waypoints are selected among available state vectors given the following set of rules:

The first point is set immediately after the the aircraft’s expected departure, or after the network received the first poisition when the aircraft entered its reception range.

The last point is set right before the aircraft’s expected arrival, or the aircraft left the networks reception range.

There is a waypoint at least every 15 minutes when the aircraft is in-flight.

A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes its track more than 2.5°.

A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes altitude by more than 100m (~330ft).

A waypoint is added if the on-ground state changes.

Tracks are strongly related to flights. Internally, we compute flights and tracks within the same processing step. As such, it may be benificial to retrieve a list of flights with the API methods from above, and use these results with the given time stamps to retrieve detailed track information.

Operation¶
GET /tracks

Request¶
